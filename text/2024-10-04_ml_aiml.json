            "content": "Please enable Javascript to see this feature. Welcome back to Creating the Impossible Ad, a series covering the Google AI Lighthouse program, which challenges agencies to make an impossible ad campaign with the help of Google AI. Previously, we shared how digital-first marketing and technology services provider Monks built a personalization-driven campaign for sleep wellness company Hatch. Here, we talk to Tombras, the creative agency behind a successful AI-powered out-of-home campaign (OOH) for moving and storage company PODS. Advertising agency Tombras created an AI-powered OOH campaign for PODS featuring copy that changed depending on real-time data. How many lines of copy is it reasonable to ask an agency to write for an OOH campaign? A hundred? A thousand? What if the copy is displayed on the side of a truck, changing in real time to address almost every neighborhood in New York City? Some might call it an impossible campaign \u2014 or at least one that would take many months to execute. But for creative agency Tombras, it took just 12 days from the day they kicked off creative development. \u201cThe World\u2019s Smartest Billboard\u201d campaign for moving and storage company Portable On Demand Storage (PODS) was Tombras\u2019 answer to the Google AI Lighthouse program brief, which challenged agencies to use Google AI to conceive and execute an impossible campaign, made possible with AI. In June, the participating agencies, including Tombras, unveiled their work at the Cannes International Festival for Creativity. Here\u2019s how Tombras did the impossible with the help of Google AI. To get started, the team asked Gemini for Google Workspace to suggest moments in the creative process where generative AI could contribute meaningfully. Gemini\u2019s suggestions helped the cross-functional team break down silos. \u201cThere\u2019s a misconception that AI can replace positions in some cases, maybe automate some things. But in reality, it made our team work much closer together in ways we hadn\u2019t before \u2014 even though we\u2019re a full-service agency,\u201d said Ryan Edwards, chief digital officer at Tombras. \u201cCreative, production, media, strategy, analytics, all of that, we do in-house, and we do work really closely. But this project forced us to play a part in each stage together.\u201dThe team trained Gemini on external data (for example, Google reviews, podcast transcripts, and industry reports) and internal data (such as, client briefing transcripts, marketing data, and audience insights). Once equipped with that information, they prompted Gemini to generate a creative brief. And generate, it did: After ingesting thousands of individual artifacts, Gemini produced 27 comprehensive pages of material. The next step required creatives to review the document to better understand the massive volume of information at their disposal and work with Gemini to distill the perfect brief. By honing in on key findings, the team was able to reprompt Gemini and trim the brief to a focused and actionable three pages. \u201cThis [brief-making] was a testament to the scale, quickness, and ability of AI,\u201d said Tombras\u2019 executive creative director Avinash Baliga of the experiment, adding that it was also a testament to the importance of human decision-making in the process. During this stage, the team uncovered the insight that would lead to their impossible ad campaign. In one episode of the podcast \u201cHow I Built This,\u201d PODS founder Peter Warhurst tells host Guy Raz that the PODS containers themselves were the brand\u2019s first billboards. For Baliga, the idea of containers-as-billboards unlocked the rest. \u201cIt was great to take that initial piece of insight \u2014 that this has always been their most effective piece of advertising \u2014 and ask, can we take AI and build on that? That was the semi-idea we fed [the] AI and from there, things went further.\u201d To finalize the thousands of lines of copy needed for the campaign, the team first had to develop the right tone. \u201cThis was an exercise of trying to create a new voice,\u201d said Baliga. \u201cWe want it to be smart and hyperaware, but friendly. So the creatives, in turn, become creative directors and try to coach Gemini into getting it out.\u201d That coaching took many forms, from providing example copy to asking Gemini to pretend to be a 23-year-old living in a given neighborhood. Along with the role-playing prompts, Tombras used resources like brand archetypes and existing copy samples to help Gemini arrive at the first batch of lines. The team used the best of this group in combination with other materials and prompts to generate the next set of outputs. The selects were used to prompt Gemini again, culminating in 6,000 lines that contained the heart of the campaign. On the day of the activation, the billboard aired at least five lines per neighborhood, each one curated by a human expert. \u201cI would personally never agree to writing 6,000 lines,\u201d said Baliga. But, with AI, the team was able to achieve the volume and variety that led to the second part of their ambitious campaign: Tailoring each line of copy to the neighborhood in which it would appear in real time. \u201cWe built an API that was able to combine all the headline data plus all the real-time data and then provide it back to the truck to display,\u201d said Tombras\u2019 chief technology officer Juan Tubert. The API lived on the Google Cloud Platform and combined Vertex AI, Gemini, Maps, Sheets, and Cloud Run functions. In 29 hours, the truck traversed a total of 299 neighborhoods across the five boroughs, and the response was staggering. \u201cI was shocked when the results came in,\u201d said Edwards. \u201cI was thinking it would be cool and capture a lot of attention, but not that it would return same-day and same-week results.\u201d PODS website sessions were up 60% and requests for quotes \u2014 a key indicator of performance \u2014 were up 33% in the New York City area. The campaign results represented the biggest weekly year-over-year lift in New York for the brand in years. \u201cOur portable moving and storage containers have functioned as our billboards since PODS was founded over 25 years ago. Now, with the help of Google AI and Tombras, we can continue bringing that concept to life in a modernized and digitized way,\u201d said Calvin Fields, VP of brand and media at PODS. \u201cNot only were we able to reach customers across the Big Apple, we have found a new way to engage consumers, which is evident from the results.\u201d For Tombras, it was also proof positive that Gemini is an effective tool for experienced creative teams. Since the PODS campaign, Tombras has built their own AI suite of custom applications for their teams and clients. They now use Gemini to craft briefs and creative work for clients across their portfolio, applying what they learned from the campaign. \u201cThe process, for us as an agency, was incredible, because we started understanding where Gemini could play more of a part and where humans could play more of a part,\u201d said Baliga, referring to the agency\u2019s direction and curation of Gemini\u2019s outputs. \u201cVoice and tone have always been slightly ephemeral. \u2026 For that to translate into something that feels unique is probably the hardest job. The fact that we could get a machine to be in on that exercise was really surprising. That\u2019s going to be really interesting going forward.\u201d \u201cThe World\u2019s Smartest Billboard\u201d is just one of the successful campaigns that harnessed Gemini for the Google AI Lighthouse program.

Keep following for more technical guidance, case studies, and insights. By: AI Team\n\t\t\n\t\t\tOctober 03, 2024\nRead time:\u00a0 ( words)\n\t Save to Folio Previously in this series, we\u2019ve taken a deep dive into Rogue AI to understand what it is and how we can identify it. In the last blog, we also looked at possible mitigations. Our aim here is to help shape the debate around the future of cybersecurity threats and find the most effective ways to minimize the risks they pose to individuals, companies and society at large. In this piece, we\u2019ll explore community efforts currently underway to assess AI risk. While there\u2019s some great work being done, what they\u2019re missing to date is the idea of linking causality with attack context. Who\u2019s doing what? Different parts of the security community have different perspectives on Rogue AI: Let\u2019s take a look at each in turn. OWASP Rogue AI is related to all of the Top 10 large language model (LLM) risks highlighted by OWASP, except perhaps for LLM10: Model Theft, which signifies \u201cunauthorized access, copying, or exfiltration of proprietary LLM models.\u201d There is also no vulnerability associated with \u201cmisalignment\u201d\u2014i.e., when an AI has been compromised or is behaving in an unintended manner.\n\nMisalignment: Excessive Agency is particularly dangerous. It refers to situations when LLMs \u201cundertake actions leading to unintended consequences,\u201d and stems from excessive functionality, permissions or autonomy. It could be mitigated by ensuring appropriate access to systems, capabilities and use of human-in-the-loop. OWASP does well in the Top 10 at suggesting mitigations for Rogue AI (which is a subject we\u2019ll return to), but doesn\u2019t deal with causality: i.e., whether an attack is intentional or not. Its security and governance document also offers a handy and actionable checklist for securing LLM adoption across multiple dimensions of risk. It highlights shadow AI as the \u201cmost pressing non-adversary LLM threat\u201d for many organizations. Rogues thrive in shadow, and lack of AI governance is already AI use beyond policy.\u00a0 Lack of visibility into Shadow AI systems prevents understanding of their alignment. MITRE ATLAS MITRE\u2019s tactics techniques and procedures (TTPs) are a go-to resource for anyone involved in cyber-threat intelligence\u2014helping to standardize analysis of the many steps in the kill chain and enabling researchers to identify specific campaigns. Although ATLAS extends the ATT&CK framework to AI systems, it doesn\u2019t address Rogue AI directly. However, Prompt Injection, Jailbreak and Model Poisoning, which are all ATLAS TTPs, can be used to subvert AI systems and thereby create Rogue AI. The truth is that these subverted Rogue AI systems are themselves TTPs: agentic systems can carry out any of the ATT&CK tactics and techniques (e.g., Reconnaissance, Resource Development, Initial Access, ML Model Access, Execution) for any Impact. Fortunately, only sophisticated actors can currently subvert AI systems for their specific goals, but the fact that they\u2019re already checking for access to such systems should be concerning. Although MITRE ATLAS and ATT&CK deal with Subverted Rogues, they do not yet address Malicious Rogue AI. There\u2019s been no example to date of attackers installing malicious AI systems in target environments, although it\u2019s surely only a matter of time: as organizations begin adopting agentic AI so will threat actors. Once again, using an AI to attack in this way is its own technique. Deploying it remotely is like AI malware, and more besides\u2014just as using proxies with AI services as attackers is like an AI botnet, but also a bit more. MIT AI Risk Repository Finally, there\u2019s MIT\u2019s risk repository, which includes an online database of hundreds of AI risks, as well as a topic map detailing the latest literature on the subject. As an extensible store of community perspective on AI risk, it is a valuable artifact.\u00a0 The collected risks allow more comprehensive analysis. Importantly, it introduces the topic of causality, referring to three main dimensions: Intent is particularly useful in understanding Rogue AI, although it\u2019s only covered elsewhere in the OWASP Security and Governance Checklist. Accidental risk often stems from a weakness rather than a MITRE ATLAS attack technique or an OWASP vulnerability. Who the risk is caused by can also be helpful in analyzing Rogue AI threats. Humans and AI systems can both accidentally cause Rogue AI, while Malicious Rogues are, by design, intended to attack. Malicious Rogues could theoretically also try to subvert existing AI systems to go rogue, or be designed to produce \u201coffspring\u201d\u2014although, at present, we consider humans to be the main intentional cause of Rogue AI. Understanding when the risk is caused should be table stakes for any threat researcher, who needs to have situational awareness at all points in the AI system lifecycle. That means pre- and post-deployment evaluation of systems and alignment checks to catch malicious, subverted or accidental Rogue AIs. MIT divides risks into seven key groups and 23 subgroups, with Rogue AI directly addressed in the \u201cAI System Safety, Failures and Limitations\u201d domain. It defines it thus: \u201cAI systems that act in conflict with ethical standards or human goals or values, especially the goals of designers or users. These misaligned behaviors may be introduced by humans during design and development, such as through reward hacking and goal mis-generalization, and may result in AI using dangerous capabilities such as manipulation, deception, or situational awareness to seek power, self-proliferate, or achieve other goals.\u201d Defense in depth through causality and risk context The bottom line is that adopting AI systems increases the corporate attack surface\u2014potentially significantly. Risk models should be updated to take account of the threat from Rogue AI. Intent is key here: there\u2019s plenty of ways for accidental Rogue AI to cause harm, with no attacker present. And when harm is intentional, who is attacking whom with what resources is critical context to understand. Are threat actors, or Malicious Rogue AI, targeting your AI systems to create subverted Rogue AI? Are they targeting your enterprise in general? And are they using your resources, their own, or a proxy whose AI has been subverted. These are all enterprise risks, both pre- and post-deployment. And while there\u2019s some good work going on in the security community to better profile these threats, what\u2019s missing in Rogue AI is an approach which includes both causality and attack context. By addressing this gap, we can start to plan for and mitigate Rogue AI risk comprehensively.

Today\u2019s funds came from Bain Capital Ventures, which led the round, and it was joined by a number of globally renowned companies. They included eBay Inc., Nvidia Corp., Citi Ventures, HSBC Ventures and LG Technology Ventures, plus venture capital firms such as DST Global, StepStone Group, Schroders Capital, Premji Invest, Dorsal Capital, BAM Elevate, Adams Street and Fin Capital. The lengthy list of investors also included the startup\u2019s existing backers, Felicis Ventures and Redpoint Ventures, which led the company\u2019s $100 million Series A and $26 million seed rounds, respectively. The round brings Poolside\u2019s total amount raised to date to $626 million, and it\u2019s now valued at a cool $3 billion, according to a report in Bloomberg. The long list of investors and the huge amount of money raised suggests Poolside is onto something special with its generative AI-powered coding assistant models, which are an alternative to GitHub\u2019s popular Copilot. Indeed, there\u2019s every reason to think its technology should be just as good, if not better, since Poolside co-founder and Chief Executive Jason Warner formerly worked as the chief technology officer of GitHub, having previously headed engineering at Canonical Ltd. and Heroku Ltd. Warner co-founder Eiso Kant, who is now Poolside\u2019s CTO, also has a strong pedigree, having previously founded a number of developer tech-focused startups. Poolside has developed its own generative AI coding models, designed to help developers with things such as auto-completion of code and suggesting lines of code that are relevant in a particular context or for a specific codebase. The startup claims a number of Global 2000 companies as customers, though it has disclosed only a handful of them on its website. Where Poolside stands out from other AI coding rivals is through its reinforcement learning-based approach to training its models. Reinforcement learning enables its models to learn over time based on code execution feedback, so they will constantly improve as they complete millions of tasks in real-world software projects. The startup is also building a custom stack, or software toolkit for AI training tasks, complete with features that enable researchers to manage the datasets used in their machine learning projects. Its software also includes tools for automating tasks such as measuring the accuracy of newly-built large language models. In a statement, Warner said he believes that only a handful of companies will eventually achieve what\u2019s known as \u201cartificial general intelligence,\u201d which is a more advanced form of AI that would effectively think and learn by itself, in the same way as humans can. AGI, the potential for which remains controversial, is exactly what Poolside claims to be building. \u201cWe believe software development will be the first broad capability where AI will reach and surpass human-level intelligence,\u201d Warner said. \u201cThrough our team, our applied research and a powerful revenue engine, Poolside will bring AI for software development so that anyone in the world can build.\u201d Poolside added that the money from today\u2019s round is already being put to use, as it has already invested in a batch of 10,000 Nvidia graphics processing units for training its future models. The funds will also help to boost its go-to-market and research and development initiatives, the company said. Although there remain serious concerns about the security and reliability of AI code generation tools, with many thought to be guilty of plagiarizing existing code, developers have shown lots of enthusiasm for them. In a recent poll by GitHub, an overwhelming majority of respondents said they\u2019re using AI tools to assist their development work. GitHub itself has accumulated more than 1.8 million paying users for its Copilot assistant. Poolside isn\u2019t the only AI coding startup to attract megabucks from VCs either. Its rivals include Magic AI Inc., which bagged $200 million in fresh funding in July, and there are many others, such as Augment Inc., which closed on a hefty $227 million Series B round that lifted its valuation to $977 million. Meanwhile, Cognition AI Inc., creator of Devin, closed on a $175 million funding round led by Founders Fund in March, bringing its value to $2 billion. The likes of Amazon Web Services Inc. and Google LLC also compete with their CodeWhisperer and Gemini Code Assist tools, and various startups exist, such as Tabnine Ltd., Codegen Inc., Refact, Laredo Labs Inc. and TabbyML Inc.

            "content": "AI or artificial intelligence has been a part of PC gaming for decades. Enemies that duck behind cover when taking fire, NPCs leaving their houses to work the field in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, pedestrians and cars moving out of the way in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City - it's all AI, more... or less. We'd call these examples 'old AI,' where specific rules and a predetermined set of actions are followed, like someone completing a checklist. Modern AI or generative AI is different. Complex models are trained on large data sets that can generate, predict, and create content. NVIDIA has been at the forefront of bringing this new form of AI to PC gaming. Since the arrival of the first GeForce RTX GPU in 2018, DLSS, or Deep Learning Super Sampling, has presented a new way to boost performance, giving PC gamers a generational improvement thanks to dedicated AI hardware called Tensor Cores. As machine learning keeps evolving, so too has DLSS. DLSS is now part of RTX AI, a suite of technologies that leverage the industry-leading AI capabilities of GeForce RTX graphics cards for developers, creators, and gamers. From video production to giving architects the power to showcase their creations with photo-realistic ray-traced lighting in real-time, this article will instead focus on the ways generative AI has changed the way we play games now, how we revisit games from the past and how it will change the future. One of the reasons DLSS was developed was that NVIDIA was at the forefront of another game changer, real-time ray tracing. Ray-tracing, or RT, requires a lot of GPU horsepower, making it the perfect candidate for cutting-edge AI technology. The jump from DLSS 1.0 to DLSS 3.5 is impressive. The AI-powered Super Resolution tech not only continues to deliver a sizable boost to performance but also maintains visual fidelity comparable to or better than native rendering. In 2024, playing a PC game with ray-tracing, like Star Wars Outlaws, is an experience where DLSS is required. DLSS 3.5's Ray Reconstruction technology is, at its core, an AI solution for 'denoising,' a crucial step in the rendering process that makes the overall image clear and artifact-free. Ray Reconstruction isn't simply a replacement for existing denoisers; it dramatically improves the visual fidelity of ray-traced lighting, reflections, and more. In Star Wars Outlaws, it's night and day, DLSS 3.5 Ray Reconstruction makes the world come alive, and the shiny interiors of Imperial strongholds and Stormtrooper armor look crisp, detailed, and like the real thing. Compared to the first PC games to implement ray tracing, the RT in Star Wars Outlaws is exponentially more complex and impossible to experience at its full potential without DLSS 3 and Frame Generation. Introduced with the GeForce RTX 40 Series, new specialized AI hardware and a powerful AI model are leveraged to generate entire frames. In Star Wars Outlaws, on a capable GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU, this means up to 100 FPS or more. Throw in the impressive latency reduction tech NVIDIA Reflex, another magic trick, and at any given point, more than half of the pixels you see on the screen are generated by AI. An incredible achievement in and of itself, but most importantly, it looks and feels great to play. NVIDIA ACE isn't one technology but a suite of AI technologies that can be used to create Digital Humans with whom you can interact and engage in conversation. Partnering with AI visionaries like Convai and Inworld and game publishers like Ubisoft, these Digital Humans are already making their way to PC games. Running locally on a powerful GPU like the GeForce RTX 4090 or in the cloud on cutting-edge NVIDIA hardware, this technology is on track to change how we play forever. How does it work? Well, it's far more complex, intricate, and involved than this description - but here goes. AI powers each Digital Human, and each Digital Human can be tailored and customized, aka given a personality. In NVIDIA's impressive Covert Protocol tech demo, each character has a history, a temperament, and specific things they know or don't know relative to the world. Digital Humans respond dynamically when you speak to them using natural language, like engaging with a talking ChatGPT. Whether you're asking for the time, trying to locate something or someone crucial to the plot, or finding out more about their history, no response is scripted. AI generates everything. And by everything, NVIDIA ACE also uses generative AI to understand player speech, animate faces, and generate the emotive voice you hear. On top of this, DLSS Super Resolution, DLSS 3.5 Ray Reconstruction, and Frame Generation deliver an impressive ray-traced world to explore. Imagining how this could work in a game like The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim or Cyberpunk 2077 is mind-boggling; talking to a party member in an RPG and getting a dynamic response would be a monumental moment for PC gaming. And it's right around the corner. The first game to include an NVIDIA ACE-powered Digital Human is Mecha BREAK, a multiplayer mech game where you can engage with the mechanic to get information on missions, load-outs, and more. NVIDIA's new Project G-Assist is an RTX-powered AI Assistant for PC games that can see what's on-screen while having immediate access to all the intricacies of the game you're playing and your PC hardware. That brief description might not sound all that revolutionary, but seeing is believing. To demonstrate the potential of Project G-Assist, NVIDIA partnered with the developers behind the Unreal Engine 5-powered ARK: Survival Ascended, a popular survival franchise set in a world full of dinosaurs, to showcase its potential. Like DLSS, Project G-Assist is powered by a powerful Large Language Model (LLM) that understands game mechanics, rendering, and more. In ARK: Survival Ascended, you can ask it to identify what dinosaurs are roaming in front of you at any given moment. Bringing up your inventory, you can ask about various crafting recipes, what you can make, what you might need, and where to find it. Looking over your character stats, you can also get advice on how to spend skill points and what abilities will best suit your playstyle. These walkthrough or Wiki-style aspects of Project G-Assist are impressive and feel like having an AI Assistant for PC games. However, it doesn't stop there. Project G-Assist can give you technical information, advice, and support. Want to know how fast the game is running, presented as a graph covering the last five minutes of gameplay? Project G-Assist can whip that up for you in a few seconds. Want to optimize performance or GPU efficiency? Project G-Assist will help. With direct access to NVIDIA's in-depth performance metrics, it's like having direct access to someone who has spent days benchmarking and tweaking. It's like having one of the TweakTown staff on speed dial to optimize your game and rig. Digital Humans powered by NVIDIA ACE and Project G-Assist are new, incredible AI-powered technologies that will change the PC gaming landscape. However, there's one RTX AI technology from NVIDIA that isn't looking to the future - instead, it's looking to the past. Specifically, the rich history of PC gaming and the sizable and passionate community of developers and modders breathing new life into the games of yesteryear. RTX Remix is a powerful and open-source tool that allows tinkerers and modders of all skill levels to take a classic game and inject it into RTX Remix. RTX Remix will automatically replicate and recreate the game with access to modern physically-based rendering and lighting. Modders can then use RTX Remix to replace all lighting in older titles with full ray-tracing or Path Traced lighting. This feature alone is incredible. DLSS technologies like Super Resolution, Ray Reconstruction, and Frame Generation can also be leveraged to boost performance and fidelity. NVIDIA Reflex can improve system latency to make games feel smoother to play. AI can be used to upscale and update existing textures to bring them into the world of 4K gaming. AI models like ComfyUI can generate brand-new textures and materials to change the look of the world you see. Models can be swapped out with more detailed versions to make a game from 2004 look like one from 2024. NVIDIA first showcased the potential of RTX Remix with its Portal with RTX mod, which looks so good that it feels like a full-blown remake of Valve's iconic first-person mind-bender. Currently, tens of thousands of modders are experimenting with RTX Remix, and over a hundred or more RTX Remix projects are in development, covering everything from Deus Ex to Max Payne to Need For Speed. One of the most high-profile remixes in development is Half-Life 2: An RTX Remix Project from Orbifold Studios - a team of over 100 modders. With RTX Remix, one of the greatest PC games of all time, is being remade with some of the most incredible visuals. Technically, it's a mod, but the results are as impressive as what you'd get from a team of hundreds working for several years on a modern AAA game.

Employees who use AI tools seem convinced of their productivity benefits, according to a recent US study. A research team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) surveyed over 9,000 employees in nine countries on their perceptions of task automation and the proliferation of machine-based tools in the world of work. Several reports claim that millions of jobs are set to disappear by 2030, due to technological progress. These alarmist forecasts could lead working people to fear that they will ultimately be replaced by intelligent machines. But workers seem convinced that automation and robotisation do not necessarily mean that they'll be replaced. In fact, 60% of employees who have worked in tandem with robots or AI tools expect these technologies to have a positive impact on their safety, productivity and career development. However, the MIT researchers found that respondents' degree of optimism varied from country to country. Workers in France, for example, are less confident than those in Australia and Spain about their future prospects in the face of the rise of robotics and AI systems. Fewer of them believe that recent technological advances will help them to progress professionally. Similarly, British workers are more skeptical than Italians and Poles about the supposed safety benefits of robots and AI. But the most distrustful are Americans. Workers in the US believe that automation and robotization will harm their pay. They are also convinced that their jobs are likely to be threatened by the deployment of generative AI and robots. \"Given the reputation of the United States as a center of technological innovation and a supporter of innovative advances, this pessimism toward the impact of technology on work is surprising,\" the MIT researchers write in their research. Nationality aside, it seems that employees' level of job satisfaction has a major influence on their degree of optimism about automation and robotization. \u201cWorkers who are more satisfied in their jobs \u2013 as well as workers who feel more valued by their employers \u2013 are also more likely to see potential benefits of automation and new technologies for their work,\" reads the study. In other words, executives and managers have every interest in ensuring the well-being of their employees, if they want them to make the most of the potential offered by new technologies. \u2013 AFP Relaxnews Related stories: These job skills are most and least likely to be replaced by AI, says new study\n \nTopic:\n \n\n\n Report it to us.

In fact you can read that book all you want, and then if you bought it, you could even loan it to a friend. Websites that we open to all, also OK to read. I hope you spend your time wisely now that you know all this material is available to you. Good health to you. Tell that to the public libraries, who are battling this very issue.  They can't seem to get a break from copyright infringement. The entire work, sure. Brief quotes, perhaps as part of a larger unique work? Hmmm. You already do. Digital content is copied to your device for the purposes of display and copied into your memory for the purposes of consumption by you. The latter isn't verbatim, the former is transitive. AI works in a similar way. I suspect this will hinge on how Facebook got access to the books. If they actually pirated them they may be in trouble. If they bought them then this copyright lawsuit will go nowhere just like all the others have gone nowhere. Using an AI to reconstruct the source material it was constructed on the basis of is a too much like hard work to justify the gold-digging of the authors and publishers. Copyright exist, according to the US constitution, to 'promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts'. This use of it is blocking that advance. Where common people get hanged for minor things, the mighty can do as they please. Sad but often true. I wonder if it would be useful to set up some honeypots that would make robots think they've hit on a motherload of text documents, but were in fact being fed a trove of machine-generated text that looked plausible if a human skimmed a small portion, but as a whole taught any LLM a bunch of nonsense. Heh, I bet Meta doesn't use its own troll farms. As far as I know, \"poisoning the well\" is by far the best widely-available means to fight back against data harvesters.  We owe them nothing except our ill will. You don't need to do that. The internet is full of spam, bot farms, SEO websites and more. But the AI crawlers do a prefiltering for quality to avoid that. Avoiding spam targeted on AI would not even require new measures, it would just be detected as low quality text.

So if I train myself using some pirated books, should I expect to be sued too?  ... pirated books ... Yes, because you knew they were the fruit of a crime.  If anything raises suspicion, always claim ignorance:  Since the hypothetical books were in your possession, you know something about them:  The \"I know nothing, nothing!\" defense is inadmissible.  You need an answer that shows you were an innocent by-stander.  ... pirated books ... Yes, because you knew they were the fruit of a crime.

This is why it is legal to give, loan, or resell a copy of a book, musical recording, or video performance.  Note that this does not allow for making additional copies of that work, but applies solely to the disposition of the existing copy of that work. But generally speaking, yes.

Thoes laws did not anticipate LLMs, and people feel morally violated. A machine reading all the books is not the same as humans reading books. It is not the action that matters, nor the fact that humans are a kind of machine. It is the morality of the totality of the circumstances and what it means for human rights and society. Right now there is outrage. So, if a bunch of humans decide to voraciously consume books from a local library or bookstore, it\u2019s perfectly acceptable use for the author.  But if \u201cAI\u201d reads the books, it\u2019s considered..theft? I\u2019m not a lawyer. Still barely makes sense. The laws (such as Copyright) embody and are used to execute our morality. Thoes laws did not anticipate LLMs, and people feel morally violated. A machine reading all the books is not the same as humans reading books. It is not the action that matters, nor the fact that humans are a kind of machine. It is the morality of the totality of the circumstances and what it means for human rights and society. Right now there is outrage. Your memory must be a lot better than mine. I'll remember the general content of a book, but won't remember it word for word. I can't write a sentence directly from that book if someone asks me the right question - at least not without going to that book and finding it in the book for them. LLMs don't think back about what they read and give you its understanding of historical context. LLMs keep a full copy of all of that text and regurgitate parts of it. They might mix and match parts of sentences, but the  The US constitution gives the Federal government the right to offer copyright protection 'To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts'. Blocking the availability of text online for the advance of AI is thus an abuse of the power. Authors and Publishers are trying it on to get an extra source of revenue that they had no reason to expect when they created / published the works. The courts need to strike down this gold-digging.

Blocking the availability of text online for the advance of AI is thus an abuse of the powerBy that logic, should I also be allowed to pirate, print, and distribute any educational text?  Distributing knowledge would very likely promote progress.  In fact, you could probably justify piracy of just about any media: consumption of a wide range of content would likely lead to inspiration and progress in Useful Arts.\n\nIt doesn't make much sense to read the constitutional clause granting Congress the right to issue copyright as saying that copyright is invalid in the vast majority of cases.

The basic business model of authors and publishers of educational texts is to 'To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts' by creating and selling those texts; for them to have them stolen by copying is to destroy their ability ''To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts'. By contrast whether a text is used for input to an LLM AI is not destroying that ability, so should not be protected by copyright unless the LLM can be enticed into easily regurgitating large amounts of the text - above t  You can just post a notice on your FB page that says you do not consent to this. But hurry, the deadline for posting this is coming up soon! It probably is fair use to train AI on legally obtained books.  If it weren't, gleaning any sort of knowledge by reading would be illegal.  Training AI on pirated book, however, is probably not legit.  The training part is fine, the \"pirated content\" part isn't. There may be more comments in this discussion.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n Travel agents may be mostly a relic of the past, but Priceline has used AI to create a new one. Penny Voice is designed to help you book trips by conversing with you like a human. Priceline turned to OpenAI and its new Realtime API introduced this week to create Penny, leveraging GPT-4o and the technology underlying the Advanced Voice Mode for ChatGPT. Penny Voice augments the existing Priceline AI travel assistant with the new tools from OpenAI. Natural, conversational speech with a user processed by the AI models allows Penny to understand complex requests and even anticipate what you want before you lay it out. It also has a memory for previous interactions and stated preferences to customize how it responds in future conversations. Penny Voice is starting out just on hotel reservations, and you can talk to it on the Priceline iOS app or on its website.\u00a0 For travelers, Penny Voice can streamline getting a trip together. Instead of searching through websites and writing long, detailed requests, you can talk to Penny like the AI is a human. The AI will help find hotels and offer suggestions for places to eat and things to do. Priceline plans to add flights, rental cars, and vacation packages to Penny's capabilities soon.\u00a0 \"At Priceline, we've always pushed technological boundaries to make travel easier. With Penny Voice, we're further redefining how people plan and book travel,\" Priceline CEO Brett Keller said. \"Our collaboration with OpenAI includes a continuous feedback loop, allowing us to rapidly innovate, enhance, and now literally bring Penny to life. We're extremely proud of our work together and the results.\" Priceline claims Penny stands out from rival voice AI tools due to contributions from within the company and from OpenAI. Priceline brings a huge amount of information on its customers and its proprietary deals engine to the table. And thanks to OpenAI\u2019s Realtime API, Penny can reflect your emotions, adjusting tone and phrasing to match emotional cues and mimicking human conversation better.\u00a0 Priceline held auditions with more than a hundred voice actors to figure out the perfect voice to clone with AI and make for a friendly, approachable AI voice. Not just in English, either. Penny Voice can identify and answer queries in more than 120 languages. Ultimately, Penny will serve as a test for both Priceline\u2019s AI investment and whether putting AI voices into everything will count as a win for OpenAI. \u201cIntegrating Realtime API with Penny is a great example of how companies can use our tools to build natural conversation experiences into their applications,\" OpenAI Head of API Product Olivier Godement said. \u201cWe\u2019re\u201d thrilled to work with Priceline to help them build an AI-powered booking experience for their customers.\u201d Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

Well, before Samsung brings the product to the market, Meta has launched its competitor. Well, sort of, as you can\u2019t purchase it, ever.\nMeta, at its Connect event, has made four major announcements. First, the company showcased Orion, a pair of augmented reality (AR) glasses. Second, it has launched the Meta Quest 3S, a new mixed reality (MR) and virtual reality (VR) headset that is more affordable version of the Meta Quest 3. Third, Meta has dropped the price of the Meta Quest by up to $150. Fourth, the brand announced new AI features for the Ray-Ban | Meta Smart Glasses.\nMeta showcases Orion, the company\u2019s first AR glasses\nThe Meta Orion looks and feels similar to regular pair of glasses with transparent lenses, allowing people to see the world around them. However, it has a pair of holographic displays and the hardware to run them, including processor, RAM, storage, battery, and various sensors. These holographic displays can overlay 2D and 3D content on physical world around you. In Meta\u2019s words, \u201cOrion bridges the physical and virtual worlds, putting people at the center so they can be more present, connected, and empowered in the world.\u201d\n\nMeta hasn\u2019t said which operating system the Orion is using (it could be running on Meta Horizon OS, the same OS that the Meta Quest 3 is running). However, the company got Meta AI working on it, which can \u201cunderstands what you\u2019re looking at in the physical world and can help you with useful visualizations.\u201d With the Meta Orion, you can take calls, chat with people over Messenger and WhatsApp, and \u201copen up your refrigerator and ask for a recipe based on what\u2019s inside,\u201d among other things.\n\nUnfortunately, Meta isn\u2019t making Orion available for the public to purchase. According to the company, this is a polished prototype that it will offering to Meta\u2019s employees and select external audiences so that they can provide their feedback on the product. Using that feedback, Meta plans on developing another, similar product, which costs less to produce. The company will make that one available for the public to purchase.\nMeta Quest 3S is here, a more affordable version of Meta Quest 3\nMeta has launched the Meta Quest 3S, a more affordable version of the Meta Quest 3. While the latter costs $499.99, the former costs just $299.99. The major difference between the two is that the new model has the same displays as the Meta Quest 2, which have lower sharpness and narrower field-of-view compared to those on the Meta Quest 3. Rest of the things remain the same. The company hasn\u2019t announced when it will make the Meta Quest 3S available to purchase.\n\nMeta Quest 3 is now $200 more affordable\nMeta has dropped the price of the Meta Quest 3\u2019s 512GB storage variant from $649.99 to $499.99. The price drop not only makes the headset much more value for money but also makes it look like a more sensible device to buy than the Apple Vision Pro.\nMeta is adding more AI features to Ray-Ban | Meta Smart Glasses\nMeta has announced five new features for the Ray-Ban | Meta Smart Glasses that are powered by artificial intelligence (AI).\nFirst, when you say \u201cHey Meta\u201d to ask a question and the smart glasses answers it, you can continue the conversation with Meta AI without saying \u201cHey Meta\u201d once again, offering you a more natural conversational experience with the chatbot.\nSecond, you can now ask Ray-Ban | Meta Smart Glasses to remember something such as your car parking spot and messaging your mom in three hours when you land safely.\n\nThird, you can now ask Meta AI to record voice messages and send them to people via Messenger or WhatsApp, making it easier for you to converse with them.\nFourth, you can ask Meta AI about anything that you are seeing. The virtual assistant will then analyse and tell you what it is or answer your question about it. Meta says \u201cif you\u2019re at the grocery store and trying to plan a meal, you can ask Meta AI to help you figure out what to make based on what you\u2019re seeing as you walk down the aisles, and if that sauce you\u2019re holding will pair well with that recipe it just suggested.\u201d\nThe story continues after the video\u2026\n\nFifth, the Ray-Ban | Meta glasses can now translate speech in real time. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking to someone speaking Spanish, French or Italian, you\u2019ll hear what they say in English through the glasses\u2019 open-ear speakers.\u201d\n                     Meta, at its Connect event, has made four major announcements.

However, it didn\u2019t have any themes. Well, that\u2019s changing today. According to a new report from WABetaInfo, [\u2026] In March this year, Meta started working on a feature for WhatsApp that allowed people to mention a contact in their status updates on the platform. Well, the feature is now available for people enrolled in the app\u2019s beta program from Android. According to a new report from WABetaInfo, the latest beta version of WhatsApp [\u2026] Last year, Apple unveiled the Apple Vision Pro, the company\u2019s first AR and VR headset. While it is very capable, it isn\u2019t useful for most people in their day-to-day lives as it doesn\u2019t replace a device or solve a problem. Plus, it is very expensive. With all that, not many are buying the product. Meta\u2019s [\u2026] In November 2022, the European Commission brought into effect the Digital Markets Act, a law that aims to ensure fair competition in the digital market by preventing large platforms from abusing their power. One of the things it focuses on is interoperability between various messaging platforms, where major services, including Meta\u2019s Messenger and WhatsApp, are [\u2026] Last month, a beta version of WhatsApp for Android brought a new feature to the platform called Lists, which lets you create lists and add people to them. However, it was accessible only to internal testers and therefore, there wasn\u2019t much information about how it worked or what benefits it offered. Well, that\u2019s changing today. [\u2026] Brian Acton and\u00a0Jan Kou started WhatsApp as an instant messaging app. However, since Meta took over the platform, the brand has been slowly adding social media features to it, especially from Instagram. Now, the Mark Zuckerberg-led company has started testing another widely used Instagram feature to WhatsApp. According to a new report from WABetaInfo, the [\u2026] Reviews Best picks Devices Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 SM-F956B Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 SM-F741B Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro SM-R630 Samsung Galaxy F55 SM-E556B Samsung Galaxy M55 SM-M556B Samsung Galaxy M15 SM-M156B Samsung Galaxy C55 SM-C5560 Samsung Galaxy A55 SM-A556E Opinions Notebook TV Social media \u00a9 2024 SamMobile We'd like to show you notifications for the latest important news and updates ...",

Learn the basics fundamentals and programming techniques required for building fully functional Augmented Reality android and iOS apps. For this course you will need an Android Smartphone or iPhone. So what is Augmented Reality? According to Wikipedia, Augmented reality (AR) is a live direct or indirect view of a physical, real-world environment whose elements are \u201caugmented\u201d by computer-generated or extracted real-world sensory input such as sound, video, graphics or GPS data. In Augmented Reality the real view is modified by a computer (Smartphone in this case). Augmented reality (AR) enhances one\u2019s current perception of reality, whereas in contrast, virtual reality replaces the real world with a simulated one. Augmentation techniques are basically performed in real time, Eg : Displaying live scores and statistics inside a live video of a sporting event Power of Augmented Reality I came across Augmented Reality in 2015 after watching a video of Augmented Reality Book. I was fascinated to know that such technology actually exists. So I started researching on different Augmented Reality platform. Vuforia platform seemed very promising as developers all over the World have used Vuforia for developing Augmented Reality apps. Pokemon Go game is the best example of Augmented Reality. Other than that Augmented Reality apps expand over a wide range of topics from Education, Business, Architecture, Health Industry, Home Decoration and obviously mobile gaming. Course Content and Overview This course is designed for students interested in creating Augmented Reality apps. No coding experience is required; all you need is an Android or iOS device for testing your Augmented Reality apps. We will start from basics of Unity, C# platform and then move to higher topics Intro & Basics of Augmented Reality In the first section you will first understand as to what is Augmented Reality? Next we will look at the four different augmented reality techniques and its application. After this I will explain you what is Virtual Reality and the differences between Augmented Reality (AR) & Virtual Reality (VR) Basics of Unity After understanding Augmented Reality next we will look at the basics of Unity as Unity is the main software which we will use for building Augmented Reality apps. Augmented Reality One (ARONE) application ARONE is the first Augmented Reality Application which you are going to create. In this app you will Create Vuforia account Create License Key for the AR app Upload an Image as Image Target Understand Vuforia Image Recognition system Solution to White ImageTarget problem in Vuforia version 6.2.10 Download 3D model from Unity Asset Store Place 3D Model on top of Image Target Download ARONE app database from Vuforia and activate it inside Unity Build this app for Android & Ios Augmented Reality Book (ARBOOK) application In the ARBook application we will first create few sketches inches a drawing book. Next we will download some 3D Models from the asset store and project the 3D Model on top of each image target. Application like ARBOOK can be implemented in Schools & Colleges for teaching complicated subjects in a fun and easier way. Virtual Button & Augmented Reality Business Card (ARBusinessCard) In this section I will explain first explain you the concept of Virtual Button in Vuforia and the six important factors that should be considered while working with Virtual Button. Next you will create a simple Virtual Button app called AugmentedRealityVirtualButton in which you will understand the important function & interface that are required for working with Virtual Button. After the ARVirtualButton app we will then create and ARBusinessCard. In the ARBusinessCard app you will first place multiple virtual buttons on top of an Image Target. Next I will show you how to play video file inside Unity, After this we will write a C# script to play a particular video when the virtual button for a particular video is pressed Augmented Reality Greeting Card In this section, you will learn the process of detecting multiple image targets simultaneously at the same time. You will also add an mp3 file in the app that will start playing only when the greeting card is opened. Superimposition based AR | Object tracking \u2013 In this section you will first scan a 3D model using Vuforia\u2019s 3D scanning android application. Next we will import this model inside Unity and on top of this model we will superimpose a digital car. Cylindrical Object tracking In this section you will learn the technique for detecting a cylindrical object. After detecting the cylindrical object you will create a beautiful 3D scenic view around the cylinder with the help of airplanes, low poly clouds and low poly terrains. Vuforia Cloud Recognition In this section you will understand the working of Vuforia cloud databases. You will create an application called BookInfoAR. This application will scan a book cover(marker) and display information panel beside the book cover. The information of the marker is stored in cloud database. Ground Planes and MidAir In this section you will create your first markerless augmented reality using Vuforia Ground Plane. With ground plane feature we will place a lifesize Lamborghini model in real world. Next using the MidAir feature we will place a drone in mid air. User Defined Target In this section you will understand a feature called User Defined Target feature from the Vuforia Core Sample. With the help of User Defined Target feature we can use any image as an marker. So after explaining you the course content I hope to see you inside this Augmented Reality course Who this course is for:\nUnity Developers interested in Augmented Reality platforms\nAnyone who wants to develop their own AR Applications\nComputer programming students interested in C# programming for building Augmented Reality applications\nDevelopers who are looking forward to create e-commerce AR application\nTeachers who are looking forward to create educational AR apps to uplift their teaching strategies\n     Your email address will not be published.

The previous installment in this series explored how manual accounts receivable (AR) processes impede businesses\u2019 cash flow and how automation offers a powerful solution to this problem. However, manual and paper-based payments are not solely an AR impediment: They also afflict accounts payable (AP), potentially having equally serious downstream consequences for businesses\u2019 financial health. Manual AP processes are expensive, labor-intensive and more susceptible to fraud and errors. While automating AR is vital to improving cash flow, failing to automate AP as well can undermine the benefits achieved. Incoming payments may be accelerated through AR automation, but outgoing payments remain slow and inefficient due to manual AP processes. This mismatch can hamper working capital management, accurate forecasting, decision-making and, ultimately, business success. By automating both AR and AP, companies can avoid these pitfalls and create a fully optimized, end-to-end financial process. This solution improves cash flow, enhances visibility, strengthens relationships with both customers and suppliers, and drives overall financial efficiency. Many businesses, regardless of size, still rely on manual AR and AP processes, leading to slow, error-prone accounting that increases fraud risk. These hazards can create significant cash flow ramifications stemming from both sides of the ledger. Manual accounting processes create significant challenges for both AR and AP, hurting overall financial efficiency and business performance. Manual AR incurs higher costs due to paper-based invoicing, manual follow-up and labor-intensive cash application. Similarly, manual AP inflates costs through manual invoice processing, check printing and time-consuming approvals. These costly procedures directly impact the company\u2019s bottom line. of firms that still use paper checks experience check fraud. The list of inefficiencies in manual processing goes on, including the risks of human error. For AR, mistakes in invoice generation, data entry and payment application can lead to billing errors, delayed payments and customer disputes. For AP, manual entry errors can cause incorrect, duplicate or missed payments to vendors. In addition, the laborious processes involved prevent teams from focusing on more strategic, value-adding activities. Manual systems also fail to provide up-to-date information. AR lacks real-time visibility into customer payment status, while AP struggles with tracking invoice status and upcoming payment obligations. This lack of visibility hinders accurate financial forecasting and decision-making. The result of all these hurdles is slower payments. For AR, slower invoice delivery and payment collection extend days sales outstanding (DSO) \u2014 the length of time it takes to get paid for sales. For AP, manual approval and paper checks delay vendor payments, potentially missing early payment discounts. This negatively impacts working capital management and supplier relationships. These strained relationships can lead to lost business opportunities and unfavorable payment terms. A recent survey revealed that 91% of small businesses face cash flow issues. As a result, 31% have missed or delayed major payments like payroll and rent. The most common consequences of these cash flow disruptions were lost growth opportunities and canceled projects. Moreover, two-thirds of small business owners said cash flow complications affected them personally, causing stress, anxiety and burnout. By addressing manual process challenges in both AR and AP, companies can create a more efficient, accurate and strategic financial operation that benefits the entire organization. Beyond processing, legacy payment methods are a hazard in and of themselves. Paper checks not only create frustrating payment delays for AR teams but also pose significant risks to AP teams. Despite the risks, many firms continue to rely heavily on paper check payments, even though 65% have experienced check fraud. Furthermore, these checks are typically sent by mail, despite a 10-percentage-point rise in fraud related to interference with the United States mail over the past year. Only 41% of firms managed to recover at least 75% of funds lost to fraud, while 30% recovered no money whatsoever. Adopting automated AR and AP with faster, electronic payment methods can streamline accounting, strengthen security and contribute to better overall financial health. 95% of companies that fully automate AP processes achieve greater accuracy, efficiency and overall operational improvements. Automated AR and AP create a seamless financial workflow, reducing labor-intensive manual data entry and potential errors across the entire payment cycle. This integrated, end-to-end system enables faster invoice processing, approval and reconciliation. In addition, the inherent upgrade to digital payments significantly reduces the risk of fraud. Integrating both AR and AP automation is crucial, moreover, because it provides a comprehensive view of an organization\u2019s financial position. It does this by enabling real-time visibility into both incoming and outgoing cash flows. This holistic perspective allows for more accurate cash flow forecasting and better working capital management. AR automation speeds up invoice delivery and payment collection, while AP automation allows for strategic timing of outgoing payments. Together, they create a synchronized cash flow cycle, empowering firms to optimize liquidity and financial stability. According to PYMNTS Intelligence research, the benefits of automating accounting processes are directly proportional to the level of automation implemented. Currently, 65% of firms have automated at least some part of their AR processes, while 64% have automated at least part of their AP processes. However, 95% of companies that fully automate their AP processes report greater accuracy, efficiency and overall operational improvements. This compares to 84% of those that have partially automated. Hence, recognition is growing around the need for full automation of both AR and AP, with most firms having further plans to innovate these processes. According to data from Esker, 83% of AP departments and 75% of AR departments see moving to fully electronic processing as important or very important.1 Payment portals that integrate electronic payments and AR/AP automation can significantly improve B2B relationships. These solutions provide both customers and vendors with real-time visibility into invoices and payments. These portals offer suppliers and customers a self-service payment option that resolves automatically, greatly reducing the workload of accounting staff. Portals process payments on the back end, and many leverage real-time transaction rails to ensure immediate fund transfers. Payment portals also improve the transparency of accounting operations, providing better visibility into issues when errors occur. This allows accounting staff to resolve problems more efficiently, minimizing the disruptions to cash flow.2 Payment portals improve transparency, streamline operations and accelerate transactions. Automating both AR and AP in this way positively impacts relationships with customers and suppliers. Customers benefit from faster, more accurate invoicing and a smoother payment process, while suppliers appreciate timely payments and better visibility into payment status. These improvements foster stronger business relationships and potentially lead to more favorable terms. Esker and Sovos have interconnected their electronic invoicing platforms to offer enhanced payment portal capabilities for their customers. This partnership allows both companies to operate as Partner Dematerialization Platforms, a designation by the French government that enables financial companies to offer bespoke payment services. Esker and Sovos will operate their own payment platforms in France but collaborate on portal initiatives internationally. This collaboration will help AR/AP departments leverage payment portal technology and improve cash flow management for their firms. Digital, automated AR and AP processes offer significant benefits to firms seeking to enhance their financial health and security. By transitioning from manual, paper-based systems to automated digital solutions, companies can reduce delays and errors while improving overall efficiency and accuracy. One of the key advantages of both AR and AP automation is the substantial reduction in processing time. Automated systems can handle invoice creation, delivery and payment processing much faster than manual methods, accelerating the entire cash flow cycle. This not only improves a company\u2019s financial position but also fosters better relationships with vendors and customers through timely payments and collections. Automation also significantly minimizes human error, a common issue with manual data entry and processing. The result is more precise financial management and more informed decision-making based on reliable data. Enhanced visibility and reporting capabilities are another crucial benefit of AR and AP automation. Real-time insights into financial positions, outstanding invoices and future payments enable better cash flow management and more strategic financial planning. This increased transparency also supports compliance efforts and helps detect potential fraud sooner, thereby bolstering financial security.  Manual AP and AR processes can significantly disrupt corporate cash flow and increase costs. By automating these functions, businesses can streamline operations, improve efficiency and gain a competitive edge. A healthy cash flow isn\u2019t simply earning more than you spend or sitting on a pile of cash. It\u2019s about ensuring your organization can react to new opportunities quickly and without breaking the bank \u2014 a key to both short- and long-term growth.\u201d 1.

            "content": "Weather forecast concept background - variety weather conditions, bright sun and blue sky, dark ... [+] stormy sky with lightnings, sunset and night Growing up, the weather wasn't just small talk in our house\u2014it was the main event. My dad's passion for meteorology\u2014he actually filmed for a major TV network\u2014turned our home into a mini weather station, complete with barometers, anemometers, and even a few strategically placed cameras to capture nature's most dramatic moments. Little did I know that those childhood experiences would one day intersect with cutting-edge blockchain and AI technology in a way that could revolutionize how we understand and interact with the weather. Enter Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks, or DePIN\u2014a concept taking the blockchain world by storm. And now, it's set to transform something as fundamental as weather forecasting. As someone who grew up pouring over wind directions before social media was a thing, this development is a compelling mix of nostalgia and innovation. Think of DePIN as the Wikipedia of physical infrastructure. Instead of relying on centralized systems (like the weather stations I used to beg my dad to visit), DePINs harness the power of individuals. People like you and me can contribute data and maintain the network, earning rewards for our efforts. It's like if my dad could have earned crypto for all those hours he spent filming thunderstorms! SkyX is bringing the DePIN model to weather data collection, and it's got me as excited as my dad used to get about an approaching cold front. Here's the lowdown: Needless to say, Dad would have loved this! But it\u2019s not just for meteorological mavens. It stands to benefit everyone by transforming the accuracy of this famously unpredictable science. As Frank Fang, the co-founder of Skyx said to me, \"The DePIN model has already proven its ability to crowdsource diverse and granular datasets quickly and at low costs. However, the result is raw, unprocessed data that requires further work to create actual value - a task that businesses may not have the funds or capacity for.\u201d A SKYX device at Token 2049 -DePIN for weather \u201cSkyX's platform takes care of that, offering software for generating industry-specific insights as its product. This way, we are building up on the concept of DePIN to make its value proposition even more immediate and palpable for both retail and enterprise users.\" I lost count of the times my dad used to (accurately!) predict rain for our street while the TV weatherman or -woman said it'd be sunny. This highlights a long standing problem with traditional weather forecasts: they only provide very broad-brush predictions. Watch the weather on TV, even today, and you\u2019ll see a rain or sun symbol covering your whole county or even state. With SkyX's dense network, everyone can have an almost street-by-street-level of accuracy through hyperlocal forecasts. The weather station you've always wanted could now pay for itself through cryptoeconomic rewards, turning weather into a source of income. From farmers to festival planners, everyone benefits from more precise weather data, making services smarter and more efficient. Better data also means better disaster preparedness, potentially saving many lives. Senior farmer standing in soybean field examining crop at sunset. And with SkyX's AI interface (SkyXGPT), complex weather data could become as easy to understand as my dad's enthusiastic storm explanations, truly making weather accessible for all. This isn't just about more accurate rain forecasts. It's about filling the gaps in our global weather monitoring system, especially in remote areas. It's the democratization of weather data\u2014something my dad always dreamed of when he talked about the importance of local observations. Of course, such advanced capabilities are only possible through harnessing the most sophisticated back-end technology and infrastructure. SkyX picked peaq as their blockchain platform, and for good reason. Peaq's specialized features for DePIN applications, like robust identity management and secure data storage, are crucial for a network of verifiable weather stations. It's the solid foundation this sky-high ambition needs. \"SkyX's value proposition obviously exceeds that of an average earlier-generation data collection DePIN, which only had raw data to propose,\u201d said Leonard Dorl\u00f6chter, co-founder of peaq. SkyX leverages this community-contributed data to offer businesses actual analytical products ready to generate actionable insights while also rewarding the contributors. It's a sign that the wider DePIN space is maturing and is now beginning to offer the world increasingly advanced, enterprise-grade products - an offer that I am sure will be met with much interest. Leonard Dorl\u00f6chter, co-founder of peaq Challenges and Limitations: While promising, SkyX's approach isn't without challenges. Ensuring data quality from thousands of individual stations is a significant hurdle. There's also the question of standardization and calibration across diverse equipment types. Additionally, regulatory frameworks for such decentralized data networks are still evolving. Privacy concerns and the potential for data manipulation are areas that SkyX and similar platforms will need to address as they grow. As I reflect on those days spent watching the skies with my dad, I can't help but feel we're on the brink of something he could only have dreamed of. SkyX and DePIN aren't just changing weather forecasting; they're inviting all of us to become part of a global community of weather observers. Imagine a world where every backyard weather enthusiast, every curious kid with a rain gauge, and every farmer with generations of weather wisdom can contribute to and benefit from a global weather network. It's a world where my dad's passion for local weather observations scales to a global level, powered by blockchain technology. This isn't just about more accurate forecasts or earning crypto rewards\u2014though those are certainly exciting prospects. It's about creating a more connected, informed, and resilient global community. It's about empowering individuals to play a crucial role in understanding and preparing for the challenges posed by our changing climate. With initiatives like SkyX, we're not just forecasting the weather; we're fostering a deeper, more participatory relationship with our environment. We're turning everyday weather watchers into custodians of crucial climate data, and in doing so, we're weaving a web of knowledge that spans the globe. So, the next time you look up at the sky, remember: you're not just observing the weather. You're potentially part of a vast, decentralized network that's revolutionizing how we understand and interact with the atmospheric world around us. And who knows? The weather station you set up in your backyard today could be the source of tomorrow's life-saving forecast or groundbreaking climate research. In the emerging horizons of blockchain-powered meteorology, we're all invited to become the weather heroes my dad always knew we could be. The future of weather forecasting isn't just in the clouds\u2014it's in our hands, our backyards, and our shared data. And that future? It's looking sunny with a high chance of innovation.

            "content": "Ayush Gupta is co-founder of LayerEdge, democratizing Bitcoin security with our verification layer.   Imagine trying to drive through a city during rush hour. The streets are packed, and progress is slow. This congestion isn't limited to physical roads; it happens in digital realms too, especially in the bitcoin network. Data congestion, an issue that surfaces when too many transactions are competing for limited space, is a growing concern. Here, I'll delve into what causes this congestion and why understanding it is crucial for anyone involved in the decentralized blockchain space. Picture a busy highway during rush hour. Cars are lined up bumper to bumper, inching forward. This is akin to what happens in a blockchain network during data congestion. When there are more transactions than the network can handle, a digital traffic jam occurs. Limited block size and the time it takes to mine new blocks exacerbate this issue. It's not just a technical hiccup; it's a fundamental bottleneck that can slow down the whole system. Too many transactions vying for attention cause delays and higher costs. In the context of blockchain networks, this means transactions get stuck in the mempool, a sort of waiting room for unconfirmed transactions. The result? Slow processing times and increased transaction fees, affecting the overall user experience. Bitcoin's infrastructure, by design, includes a 4MB block size (since the implementation of SegWit, although in practice, the block size is generally around 2MB) and an average block time of 10 minutes. This means that only a limited number of transactions can be processed at any given moment. Fancy a popular coffee shop with a single barista\u2014when the line grows long, you might find yourself waiting longer for your order. Similarly, during high-traffic periods, like market surges or notable events, bitcoin's network can get backed up. High transaction volumes, similar to more cars on a road leading to traffic jams, can overwhelm the network during peak times, causing a backlog in the mempool and slowing down transaction confirmations. Increased adoption also contributes to this congestion as more users and organizations transact on the network, especially during events like market surges. Additionally, fee-related issues play a crucial role; during busy periods, lower-fee transactions may be deprioritized, leading to further delays. Recently, the network has seen a surge in a specific type of transaction: ordinal inscriptions. These are essentially on-chain inscriptions made into the smallest unit of bitcoin, resembling NFTs on the blockchain. The introduction of a new type of token, facilitated by these inscriptions, has led to a significant increase in the number of transactions. During the final months of 2023 and early 2024, the network faced significant congestion, as seen in the growing mempool size. In mid-December, there were 117,813 unprocessed transactions and fees totaling 50.9 BTC. By the end of December, this rose to 194,374 transactions, marking a peak in network activity. The high transaction counts and fees continued into early January, with 64,664 transactions and 32.7 BTC in fees. The total size of unconfirmed transactions in the mempool reached 106.369 million bytes, peaking at 139.457 million by late January, indicating a backlog and increased transaction complexity. The mempool usage far exceeded the default 300MB threshold. This surge was a direct consequence of the growing popularity of ordinals and inscriptions, which occupied more space than regular transactions. This congestion sparked a debate within the community, with some developers, like Luke Dashjr, expressing concerns over the network's efficiency and integrity. We can all agree that for DeFi applications, speed and low transaction costs are essential. Unfortunately, data congestion in the network makes it challenging for DeFi platforms to operate efficiently. Users then find themselves in a queue, waiting for their transactions to be confirmed. This can discourage DeFi users and developers. The high costs associated with executing smart contracts and other financial transactions become a deterrent. Data congestion in the network results in several issues, including significant transaction delays, similar to being stuck in a traffic jam. This can be particularly frustrating for newcomers who might not understand the reason for the holdup. To prioritize their transactions during these congested periods, users often have to pay higher fees, making bitcoin less accessible, especially for smaller transactions. The increased demand also requires more resources to process transactions, straining miners and the network's efficiency. This congestion impacts the user experience, particularly for decentralized applications (DApps) and services that rely on the network, leading to slow transaction times and higher costs. Another dimension of this issue is the cost of time-stamping on the network. Time-stamping involves embedding data into the blockchain to create an immutable record. Given bitcoin's Fort Knox security, it's an attractive option for time-stamping. However, when the network is congested, the cost of including this data rises sharply. Imagine wanting to leave a note in a popular time capsule but finding the cost of admission prohibitively high. For many, the expense of recording information on the blockchain during peak times can be a significant barrier. Data congestion on the network is a pressing issue that impacts everyone, from casual users to developers and miners. As decentralized blockchain networks evolve, I believe understanding the causes and effects of this congestion becomes crucial. While efforts are underway to address these challenges, such as implementing Layer 2 solutions and optimizing transaction fees, the issue remains complex and multifaceted. As decentralized blockchain networks continue to grow and attract new users, managing and mitigating data congestion will be vital for the network's long-term viability and efficiency. Finding innovative solutions to these congestion issues is crucial, and the journey to making bitcoin more scalable and efficient is ongoing. We'll explore potential paths forward in future discussions, but for now, addressing data congestion remains a key focus as the network evolves.

            "content": "Blockchain currency has emerged as a transformative force in the global financial landscape. While its primary function as a decentralized digital asset has garnered attention, its potential to address economic inequality is equally noteworthy. By offering an alternative to traditional banking systems and promoting financial inclusion, blockchain currency is gradually leveling the economic playing field. This article explores how blockchain currency can reduce economic inequality and create opportunities for underserved communities worldwide. \u00a0 Empowering the Unbanked \u00a0 Financial Access for All \u00a0 One of the most significant challenges in addressing economic inequality is the lack of access to financial services. According to the World Bank, nearly 1.7 billion adults worldwide are unbanked, meaning they do not have access to a bank account or any formal financial institution. This exclusion often perpetuates poverty, as individuals without access to banking services struggle to save money, obtain credit, or engage in economic activities. Blockchain currency provides a viable solution by enabling financial transactions without the need for traditional banks. With just a smartphone and internet connection, individuals can create a digital wallet, store assets, and make transactions. This accessibility is particularly beneficial in developing regions where banking infrastructure is limited or non-existent. You can also explore Eclipse Earn for further information. \u00a0 Lower Transaction Costs \u00a0 Traditional financial systems often burden users with high transaction fees, particularly for cross-border payments. These fees can be prohibitive for low-income individuals and small businesses, further exacerbating economic inequality. Blockchain technology, however, facilitates peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries, significantly reducing transaction costs. \u00a0 Lower fees mean that more of the money sent by migrant workers, for instance, reaches their families back home. This not only improves the financial well-being of recipients but also stimulates local economies, contributing to a reduction in poverty levels. \u00a0 Promoting Economic Inclusion \u00a0 Democratizing Investment Opportunities \u00a0 Investment opportunities have historically been reserved for the wealthy, with high entry barriers preventing lower-income individuals from participating in wealth-building activities. Blockchain currency is changing this dynamic by democratizing access to investment platforms. Through tokenization, assets such as real estate, art, or commodities can be divided into smaller units and traded on blockchain platforms. This allows individuals with limited capital to invest in assets they would otherwise be unable to afford. By lowering the barriers to entry, blockchain currency enables a broader segment of the population to participate in wealth creation, thereby narrowing the wealth gap and promoting economic inclusion. \u00a0 Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Solutions \u00a0 Decentralized finance (DeFi) is another area where blockchain technology is making a significant impact on economic inequality. DeFi platforms offer financial services such as lending, borrowing, and earning interest, all without the need for traditional banks. These platforms operate on blockchain networks, ensuring transparency, security, and accessibility. \u00a0 For individuals in countries with unstable or corrupt financial systems, DeFi provides an alternative means of accessing financial services. Users can engage in lending and borrowing activities, earn interest on their assets, and even take out loans without the need for a credit check. This empowers individuals who have been excluded from traditional financial systems due to lack of credit history or other barriers. \u00a0 Enhancing Transparency and Reducing Corruption \u00a0 Transparent Transactions \u00a0 Corruption is a major contributor to economic inequality, particularly in developing countries where funds meant for public services are often siphoned off by corrupt officials. Blockchain technology's inherent transparency offers a solution to this problem. Every transaction made on a blockchain is recorded on a public ledger, which is immutable and accessible to anyone. This transparency reduces the likelihood of funds being misappropriated and ensures that financial resources reach their intended recipients. For example, governments can use blockchain technology to distribute social welfare benefits, ensuring that funds are delivered directly to the intended beneficiaries without any intermediaries. This can help reduce poverty and improve the quality of life for vulnerable populations. \u00a0 Reducing Barriers to Entry for Entrepreneurs \u00a0 Entrepreneurship is a key driver of economic growth and job creation, yet many aspiring entrepreneurs face significant barriers to entry, including lack of access to capital and bureaucratic red tape. Blockchain technology can help remove these barriers by providing a platform for fundraising and business development. Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and Security Token Offerings (STOs) are examples of how blockchain technology is revolutionizing fundraising for startups. These methods allow entrepreneurs to raise capital from a global pool of investors without the need for traditional venture capital firms or banks. By reducing reliance on traditional financial institutions, blockchain currency empowers entrepreneurs from diverse backgrounds to launch and grow their businesses, contributing to economic growth and job creation. \u00a0 Conclusion \u00a0 The role of blockchain currency in reducing economic inequality cannot be overstated. By providing financial access to the unbanked, lowering transaction costs, democratizing investment opportunities, and enhancing transparency, blockchain technology is creating a more inclusive global economy. As adoption of this technology continues to grow, it has the potential to significantly narrow the wealth gap and promote economic equality on a global scale. The transformative power of blockchain currency lies in its ability to empower individuals, particularly those who have been historically marginalized, to participate in the global economy and improve their economic well-being. \u00a0 How to comment \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Don't insult other visitors.

            "content": "In recent years, the integrity of electoral processes has been a subject of intense scrutiny. As digital technology increasingly influences various aspects of our lives, it\u2019s no surprise that it\u2019s also reshaping how we approach elections. Among the technological advancements, blockchain technology stands out as a promising solution to enhance transparency, security, and trust in electoral systems. This article explores how blockchain can transform elections by ensuring transparency and integrity, thereby restoring public confidence in the democratic process. \u00a0 Understanding Blockchain Technology \u00a0 Why Blockchain is Relevant to Elections \u00a0 The relevance of blockchain to elections lies in its ability to provide a secure and transparent method of recording votes. Traditional voting systems, whether paper-based or electronic, are susceptible to various forms of tampering, fraud, and human error. Blockchain technology, however, can address these issues by offering a system that is tamper-resistant, transparent, and verifiable by all stakeholders. \u00a0 How Blockchain Enhances Election Transparency \u00a0 Securing the Voting Process \u00a0 One of the main advantages of blockchain technology in elections is its ability to secure the voting process. Since each vote is recorded as a transaction on the blockchain, it is nearly impossible for malicious actors to alter or delete votes without being detected. This ensures that the outcome of the election accurately reflects the will of the voters, free from external manipulation. You can also explore wealth catalyst ai for further information. \u00a0 Ensuring Transparency \u00a0 Transparency is another critical aspect of fair elections, and blockchain excels in this area. With blockchain, each vote is recorded on a public ledger that can be audited by anyone with access. This means that voters, election officials, and even independent observers can verify that the votes have been counted correctly. This level of transparency can significantly reduce the chances of electoral fraud and increase trust in the electoral process. \u00a0 Enhancing Voter Confidence \u00a0 When voters are confident that their votes will be accurately counted and that the election process is transparent, they are more likely to participate in elections. Blockchain technology can enhance voter confidence by providing a clear, unalterable record of each vote. This assurance can lead to higher voter turnout and a more robust democratic process. \u00a0 Potential Challenges and Solutions \u00a0 Technical Challenges \u00a0 While blockchain holds great promise for enhancing transparency in elections, it is not without its challenges. One of the primary technical challenges is the scalability of blockchain networks. Elections involve millions of votes, and the blockchain must be able to handle this volume without slowing down or crashing. \u00a0 Addressing Scalability \u00a0 To address scalability concerns, some experts suggest using a hybrid approach that combines blockchain with traditional databases. In this model, the blockchain would handle the most critical parts of the election process, such as recording and verifying votes, while less critical data could be stored on traditional databases. This approach could help balance the need for transparency with the technical limitations of blockchain technology. \u00a0 Regulatory and Legal Challenges \u00a0 Another significant challenge is the regulatory and legal framework surrounding the use of blockchain in elections. Many countries have strict regulations regarding how elections are conducted, and integrating a new technology like blockchain would require changes to existing laws and regulations. \u00a0 Navigating Legal Frameworks \u00a0 To overcome these challenges, governments and regulatory bodies must work closely with blockchain experts to develop a legal framework that supports the use of blockchain in elections. This framework should address issues such as data privacy, voter anonymity, and the legality of blockchain-based voting systems. By creating a supportive legal environment, countries can more easily adopt blockchain technology in their electoral processes. \u00a0 Real-World Applications and Success Stories \u00a0 Estonia's E-Voting System \u00a0 Estonia is one of the few countries that have successfully integrated blockchain into its voting system. The country\u2019s e-voting system, which has been in use since 2005, relies on blockchain technology to ensure the integrity and transparency of the voting process. Estonia\u2019s success demonstrates that blockchain can be effectively used in national elections, providing a model for other countries to follow. \u00a0 Other Pilot Projects \u00a0 Several other countries, including the United States, Switzerland, and South Korea, have conducted pilot projects to test the feasibility of using blockchain in elections. These projects have shown promising results, indicating that blockchain could play a significant role in future elections worldwide. \u00a0 Conclusion \u00a0 Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize the way elections are conducted by enhancing transparency, security, and voter confidence. While there are challenges to be addressed, the benefits of using blockchain in elections are clear. As more countries explore and adopt this technology, we can expect to see a significant shift towards more transparent and trustworthy electoral processes. The future of democracy may very well depend on how effectively we can integrate blockchain into our voting systems, ensuring that every vote is counted and every voice is heard. \u00a0 How to comment \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Don't insult other visitors.

Last month the Indian government launched the Vishvasya-Blockchain Technology Stack, that would offer blockchain-as-a-service, the intention being to make governance more transparent, efficient, and accountable.  The government\u2019s initiative will simplify the integration of blockchain technology into various applications, says Sharat Chandra, a blockchain and emerging tech evangelist.  Instances of data breaches and personal information of citizens floating around in the dark web is worrying for people. \u201cWhile Aadhaar provides identity verification, Vishvasya can ensure that the data associated with those identities is immutable and tamper-proof,\u201d Chandra told businessline in an email interview, where he spoke about CBDCs leveraging blockchain tech, the potential of tokenisation in industry and distributed ledger technologies.  Chandra is working with a few state government-affiliated entities on establishing token standards for land records, with the goal of facilitating seamless transfers of land ownership and Transfer of Development Rights. He was also involved in shaping the National Strategy on Blockchain by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY) in 2021. The Vishvasya stack is designed as a Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform, which means it simplifies the integration of blockchain technology into various applications for state governments such as Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Bihar and Karnataka which have blockchain projects underway and are leading in blockchain adoption. By complementing existing frameworks like Aadhaar and Digilocker, Vishvasya enhances security, transparency, and efficiency in public service delivery. For instance, while Aadhaar provides identity verification, Vishvasya can ensure that the data associated with those identities is immutable and tamper-proof. This synergy allows for a more robust digital infrastructure where services can be delivered securely and efficiently across sectors like healthcare, education, and governance. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are poised to significantly benefit from blockchain technology. By leveraging programmability, quantum resistant cryptography and on-chain settlement, CBDCs can enhance transaction speed and security, especially for cross-border payments. Blockchain allows for real-time settlement of transactions, which can drastically reduce costs associated with traditional systems like SWIFT. While it\u2019s highly unlikely that CBDCs will completely replace SWIFT in the immediate future, they could serve as a complementary system that offers faster and more transparent transactions globally. Tokenisation has immense potential across various industries, but I believe real estate and financial assets such as bonds, money market funds, private equity and government securities are likely to lead the charge. These sectors have traditionally faced liquidity challenges, and tokenisation can democratise access by allowing fractional ownership. However, regulatory frameworks are crucial here. While we\u2019re making progress, ongoing dialogue between regulators and industry stakeholders will be key to navigating this evolving landscape. In the long term, I see Distributed Ledger Technologies becoming integral to our financial market infrastructure in several ways. Full scale adoption of tokenisation and DLT markets are still a couple of years away. A lot of groundwork needs to happen in terms of building interoperability standards and consensus on regulation of digital assets. Smart contracts can automate processes in trade finance and supply chain management, reducing delays and increasing trust among parties involved. Indian Banks\u2019 Digital Infrastructure Company, a consortium of 18 banks , is currently working on tokenisation and smart contract-based deep-tier financing for MSMEs as part of RBI\u2019s regulatory sandbox. These initiatives will aid in blockchain adoption in the banking and financial services sector. As more industries recognise these efficiencies, I expect a broader adoption of blockchain solutions across sectors such as sustainable finance and blockchain based trading of carbon credits, especially under the aegis of GIFT - IFSCA. \nComments\n BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

The asset manager said Wednesday that the move was a \"massive step in the right direction\" to \"innovate in the name of a truly decentralized and accessible financial future.\" Aptos is the blockchain behind APT, the 30th-biggest digital coin by market cap. Its network was founded by part of the team behind Meta's failed Diem project. Developers can use the blockchain to build decentralized apps (dapps), launch tokens, and more. \"We chose the Aptos network given its unique characteristics, which meet our rigorous suitability standards for the Benji platform,\u201d Franklin Templeton's head of digital assets, Roger Bayston, said. FOBXX is a digitized fund that lets customers put cash into U.S. government securities, cash, and repurchase agreements. Investors can buy shares of FOBXX and hold them in digital wallets via Franklin Templeton's Benji Investments mobile app. Franklin Templeton has put the fund on a number of blockchains, including Avalanche, Arbitrum, Stellar, and Polygon. Avalanche was the most recent addition before Aptos, coming in late August. The firm said that FOBXX is the first and only U.S.-registered fund to use a public blockchain as the system of record to process transactions and record share ownership. Franklin Templeton has been dipping its toes in the crypto world since 2019, when it started digitizing shares for a money market fund on the Stellar blockchain. It also announced a digital asset venture fund two years ago.

REV introduces a utility token that ties into real-world assets (RWA), positioning itself as a first-of-its-kind project in the cryptocurrency space that aligns with the growing trend of decentralized finance (DeFi). Analysts Forecast Significant Growth in Renewable Energy Market According to industry analysts, the global renewable energy sector is on the verge of exponential growth, driven by policy changes, technological advancements, and increased demand for green energy. With the sector valued at over $1 trillion, projections show that it will expand rapidly in the coming years. This creates a prime opportunity for REV, as its value is expected to grow alongside the booming renewable energy market. For investors seeking sustainable, impactful projects, REV stands out as a promising candidate for long-term growth and returns. What is REV? REV is more than just a cryptocurrency; it is a blockchain-based platform designed to support and fund renewable energy projects globally. As demand for clean energy sources such as solar, wind, and geothermal increases, so does the need for innovative funding solutions. REV bridges this gap, providing investors with a seamless way to contribute to renewable energy initiatives while securing significant returns on their investments. Presale & Early Investment Opportunities Early investors in REV's presale have a unique opportunity to secure tokens at a discounted rate before they are available to the general public.

These strategic partnerships will keep REV at the forefront of both the renewable energy and cryptocurrency sectors. Token Burn and Deflationary Mechanism REV employs a deflationary mechanism in which a portion of tokens will be burned over time to reduce supply, increase scarcity, and boost value.

The crypto mogul, who has been banned from the Binance leadership for lifetime, has decided to remain a part of the blockchain ecosystem as an investor. Zhao was sentenced to four months in prison on April 30 after he pled guilty for failing to deploy adequate anti-money laundering measures on the exchange and for prioritising the growth of Binance's business over compliance with US laws. Zhao, who has been an active crypto voice on social media, marked his return from the prison with multiple tweets. In one of his first public statements posted on X following his release, the multi-billionaire hinted that he is looking to fund projects related to blockchain, decentralised technologies, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and biotech. The 47-year-old businessman is ranked 61st on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index as of September 30 with a net worth of $30.8 billion (roughly Rs. 258 crore). \u201cI am a long-term investor who cares about impact, not returns. There are always more opportunities in the future than there were in the past,\u201d stated Zhao, who goes by the X handle @cz_binance. After Zhao pleaded guilty in November 2023, he stepped down from his role as the CEO of Binance. Richard Teng was appointed as Zhao's successor to lead the exchange. Commenting on the situation, Zhao said, \u201cBinance seems to be doing well without me back-seat-driving, which is excellent. Every founder's dream!\u201d Back in March 2024, Zhao said he was launching a new project called Giggle Academy as a free-for-all education project that aims to provide basic education for grades 1-12 through engaging, interactive games. No crypto token \u2013 existing or new \u2013 is part of this project, Zhao had said at the time. According to a new update, this initiative has been \u201cgoing well\u201d. gm, the food taste so good... And what a luxury to be able to have more than one piece of fruit per day!I know some of you may have a lot of questions. I won't have all the answers.Let me chill for a bit. Then figure out the next steps. There are always more opportunities in\u2026 https://t.co/9hvgp8Bo97 Despite Zhao being barred from becoming part of Binance's management team again, he remains the largest shareholder of the crypto exchange with reportedly around 90 percent shares under his belt. This gives him a vote in appointing board members and approving company policies. \n                For the latest tech news and reviews, follow Gadgets 360 on X, Facebook, WhatsApp, Threads and Google News.

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Fraud prevention platform Trustpair announced the integration of investment bank JPMorgan\u2019s blockchain-based solution Confirm to verify bank account information on Oct. 1. Confirm is a closed network for global account validation information built on Liink, the enterprise-focused permissioned and private blockchain developed by JPMorgan\u2019s Onyx division. Gloria Wan, Executive Director at Onyx by J.P. Morgan, stated that Confirm was created to provide collective intelligence to improve decision-making for companies. She added: \u201cBusinesses operate in a data-driven world, yet many still rely on inaccurate vendor and payment data when making high-value transactions, which significantly raises companies\u2019 risk of fraud, payment errors, and delays.\u201d As a result, Trustpair\u2019s over 200 customers \u2014 including companies such as Societe Generale, Decathlon, and Danone \u2014 can now verify vendor bank accounts across 15 global markets, reducing the risk of payment fraud and payment delays. Trustpair\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Baptiste Collot, added that applying JPMorgan\u2019s blockchain solution will set a higher standard for fraud prevention and user experience. JPMorgan\u2019s stance towards the blockchain industry has changed considerably since 2017, when the lender\u2019s CEO, Jamie Dimon,\u00a0called Bitcoin a fraud. In 2019, the investment bank launched its own crypto \u2014 the JPM Coin \u2014 for wholesale payments between institutions. One year later, JPMorgan launched its blockchain-focused Onyx unit. JPMorgan executed its first transaction on a public blockchain in November 2022. The bank issued and swapped 100,000 Singaporean dollars for Japan\u2019s yen with SBI Digital Asset Holdings on the Polygon blockchain using a forked version of the leading money market Aave. According to Onyx\u2019s website, JPMorgan now provides three different major products leveraging blockchain besides Liink. Coin Systems is a bank-focused solution for transfer and clearing that leverages JPM Coin. Blockchain Launch is a team within the Onyx unit that provides blockchain service to JPMorgan\u2019s clients, while Onyx Digital Assets is the investment bank\u2019s tokenization platform.

            "content": "Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), one of Australia\u2019s top four banks, has partnered with Singapore\u2019s Project Guardian to explore the benefits of tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) in financial markets, according to a report by Brayden Lindera for CoinDesk. This initiative is part of ANZ\u2019s broader effort to experiment with blockchain technology, as the bank seeks to enhance the movement of tokenized assets between different blockchain networks. In a press release on September 30, ANZ announced its collaboration with Chainlink Labs, a blockchain oracle platform, and ADDX, a Singapore-based investment firm, to test how tokenized assets like commercial papers can interact across blockchains. The project will involve using Chainlink\u2019s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to enable smoother transactions between various blockchain networks. Project Guardian, initiated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), seeks to explore and improve financial market infrastructure through the use of asset tokenization and decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. This initiative brings together policymakers and the financial sector to enhance market liquidity and efficiency. The project collaborates with several international regulators, including the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, Japan\u2019s Financial Services Agency, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, and Banque de France. It also involves industry players such as DBS Bank, J.P. Morgan, Deutsche Bank, and other financial institutions that are running pilot projects to examine various elements of tokenization and DeFi applications. Nigel Dobson, ANZ\u2019s banking services lead, had this to say: \u201cTokenised asset markets are highly fragmented, with tokenised assets and related services developed across different blockchains that are not natively interoperable. This can limit the adoption of tokenised assets, while making the integration process for financial institutions complex. We are pleased to join Project Guardian and look forward to demonstrating how our emerging Digital Assets capabilities, such as A$DC, can be used to support our customers to move goods and capital across the region.\u201c ANZ will also benefit from Project Guardian\u2019s on-the-ground support as it maintains a significant presence in Singapore.

The exchange operator carried out trials with six banks and the Bundesbank as part of the ECB's wholesale blockchain settlement trials.Commerzbank, Deutsche Bank, DZ Bank, LBBW, Bankhaus Metzler and V-Bank were connected to Boerse Stuttgart's blockchain-based settlement solution as trading and settlement participants. The system was also linked to the Deutsche Bundesbank's trigger solution and thus to the traditional euro payment system.The partners tested a large number of transactions with five tokenised securities - including bonds, funds, and a share. The focus was on the interoperability of blockchain and central bank money.Boerse Stuttgart says the tests showed that the settlement processes can be mapped automatically, step by step and directly between the trading participants - efficiently, securely and without counterparty risk. The settlement time was reduced from two days to just a few minutes.\u201cBlockchain technology is a game changer for the digitalization of the European capital market. We at Boerse Stuttgart Group are pioneers in this field. With the successful completion of the ECB blockchain tests, we have taken an important step in the EU,\" says Matthias Voelkel, CEO, Boerse Stuttgart. Welcome to Finextra.

Blockchain technologies have enabled the creation of decentralized applications which let users own and transact scarce digital assets called nonfungible tokens or NFTs. Although still in its infancy, the industry has generated over $2.5bn in transaction volume and attracted interest from organizations such as the NBA, several football (soccer) clubs, major brands, and gaming companies to create platforms for trading digital collectibles. A major question faced by NFT platforms is how to help participants value the digital items. We introduce a novel dataset and study how traditional approaches to valuation may exhibit significant biases in this market. We find that while buyers value NFTs much like we would expect them to value physical collectibles, sellers have a tendency to price sub-optimally, which causes traditional hedonic regression approaches to generate inaccurate valuations. We develop a valuation approach based on a structural model of the selling mechanism used in a popular NFT market to highlight these biases and develop a proof-of-concept decision support tool to help participants make more informed decisions. ...",

As nonfungible tokens (NFTs) entered the arena in 2021, Sorare emerged as one of the leaders in the space, offering blockchain-based football (soccer) player cards for participants to trade and use in fantasy sports games. This case explores Sorare\u2019s growth from a small start-up in Paris that struggled to secure funding, to a major player in the NFT space backed by SoftBank with a $680m funding round. It discusses the concept of NFTs and how Sorare uses the new technology in the sports industry, the challenges of launching an NFT-based business, the concept of the metaverse and it\u2019s connection to NFTs. Students are invited to debate the next steps in Sorare\u2019s strategy. Teaching objectives The purpose of the case is to understand how to build a business around NFTs and the metaverse, as well as potential use-cases of NFTs in a business-to-business setting. The specific focus is the sports industry and how Sorare partnered with sports leagues to develop a novel blockchain-based product.
